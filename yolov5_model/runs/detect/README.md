The different directories contain the predicted locations of western corn rootworm (WCR) beetles using the YOLOv5x model trained on the simulated dataset. The content of each file is summarized below.

- `arduino_1280_yolov5x`: Predictions on images taken by the Arducam and using the YOLOv5x model with an image size of 1280
- `arduino_640_yolov5x`: Predictions on images taken by the Arducam and using the YOLOv5x model with an image size of 640
- `real_1280_yolov5x`: Predictions on images taken by an iPhone and using the YOLOv5x model with an image size of 1280
- `real_640_yolov5x`: Predictions on images taken by an iPhone and using the YOLOv5x model with an image size of 640
- `sim_1280_yolov5x`: Predictions on images from the test simulated dataset and using the YOLOv5x model with an image size of 1280
